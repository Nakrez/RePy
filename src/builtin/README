This is the most elegant way I found to support built-in functions.
The BuiltinLibrary contains all built-in prototypes, types (if they are some),
and all rules that needs to be checked by the type checker or the binder.

Some built-in functions contains a custom type (like print). This has been made
to keep compatibility and check for the various number of parameters that is
not supported yet by the compiler. This may be changed later when * and **
syntax will be fully supported.

Other functions just has there prototype and type informations to keep things
working (for example abs function need only int parameter).
